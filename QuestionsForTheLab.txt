We do the struct just outside the functions?

We do not have Tokens for ENDLINE, TAB, etc. So how we do if we have an ENDLINE or TAB inside a declared string?
We have this: "Test: \"Escaped quotes\", new line\n"
String tokn: Test: "Escaped quotes", new linen
                                             ^
